# Snail

Little game implemented using [Tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell) that can be run in a Terminal.

To build and run the game you can either use `go run main.go` or just run `make run`. 
Alternatively you can run `make`. In that case a `bin` folder is created containing binaries as well as a debian 
package that can be installed using e.g. `dpkg` or `apt`. The binaries are at the moment available for Mac, Windows 
and Linux.  

You can use `make clean` for cleaning purposes.
